# Exercise:

In this folder, there are 5 datasets, each has a column "y", and a column "x". 

1. perform a linear regression on each dataset
2. visualize the model and the data as appropriate
3. carefully assess its fit and performance
	* comment on bias and variance as appropriate
4. Diagnose any problems you might find with the way the model fits the data

5. Fit a non-parametric regression model such as KNN to the data
	* does the non-parametric model fit better or worse? how do you know, what is the basis for your comparision

# Tools

* You should be able to complete this exercise using python, scikit learn, and statsmodels. All of these are available in  kcaicoop/kcaicoop_workbench .
